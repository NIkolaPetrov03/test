<h2> I love to learn about technology and programming a lot. My favorite thing to do while coding is seeing the program finally run and accomplish the goal! I really enjoy using the programming language Golang. It is very interesting, useful and can be used for a variety of different coding needs! I want to be able to use Golang fully by the end of grade 12, and be able to manage and create full softwares, sites and servers with the language!</h2>

<h2> My favorite TV show is the The Office. It's a really great show that I would reccomend to anyone. It has comedy, drama, great writing and awesome characters. I love it a lot because you really feel like it's a real office environment and the characters are real people! It's a show I can rewatch again and again. </h2>
